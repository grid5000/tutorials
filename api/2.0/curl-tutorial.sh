# This tutorial will show you how to use the [cURL](http://man.cx/curl) 
# command-line tool to issue one-shot requests against the Grid'5000 API.
# It was written for version 2.0 of the API, but you should be able to adapt most exemple to the 3.0 version.

# Prerequisites
# ---------------------------

# You'll need the cURL command-line tool. If it's not already installed, 
# use your package manager to fetch it. E.g.:
# 
#     sudo apt-get install curl
#

# Let's do some cURLing
# ---------------------------

# Test that you can access the Grid'5000 API. Replace `login`
# with your Grid'5000 login. Your Grid'5000 password will be requested when
# you hit `enter`.
# The output of the command should be:
#
#     curl -ki -u `login` https://api.grid5000.fr/2.0/grid5000/sites/\
#     rennes

# What you just did was getting the description of the `rennes` site. 
# The response is [JSON](http://json.org/) formatted (JSON is a lightweight 
# data interchange format), and contains a list of `links` to related
# resources.

# If you want to avoid entering your credentials for every request, `cURL` can 
# use a configuration file (`~/.netrc`) to store them.
# Then, you just have to pass the `-n` flag to `cURL` so that it takes it into account.
cat <<EOF >> ~/.netrc
machine api.grid5000.fr
login your-grid5000-login
password your-grid5000-password
EOF
chmod 600 ~/.netrc

# Retry the previous request with the `-n` flag, and you should get the same result.
#
#     curl -kni https://api.grid5000.fr/2.0/grid5000/sites/rennes

# If you want to see the full details of how the HTTP request is made, add the 
# `-v` flag to the command (lines prefixed with `>` and `<` repectively show 
# what is sent to, and received from the server):
#
#     curl -kvni https://api.grid5000.fr/2.0/grid5000/sites/rennes

# Looking at the list of `links` in the description of the `rennes` site, 
# you can see that there is a lot of other URIs that can be followed.
# As an example, you can retrieve the site status with the following command.
# For each node, you'll see the node state and the next reservation.
# You can have a look at the [Monitoring API documentation](https://api.grid5000.fr/2.0/status/help/index.html) 
# for more information.
#
#     curl -kni https://api.grid5000.fr/2.0/grid5000/sites/rennes/\
#     status

# You can also fetch the list of scheduled jobs on the `rennes` site by 
# issuing a request to the following URI.
# Note that you can remove the `-i` flag if you do not want to display the
# HTTP headers from the response.
#
#     curl -kni https://api.grid5000.fr/2.0/grid5000/sites/rennes/jobs

# At this point, you may want to add your very own job to the previous list.
# Use the `POST` method to create a new job that just sleeps for 30 minutes.
#
curl -kni -X POST https://api.grid5000.fr/2.0/grid5000/sites/rennes/jobs -d "command=sleep 1800"

#
# You should get back a response like the following:
