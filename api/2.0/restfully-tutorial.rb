# This tutorial will show you how to reserve nodes and deploy a specific
# environment on every site of Grid'5000 (granted there are nodes available), 
# using the [Restfully](http://github.com/grid5000/restfully) Ruby library.
#
# You can download the source file for this tutorial from here: <https://github.com/grid5000/tutorials/blob/master/api/2.0/restfully-tutorial.rb>.
#
# As `cURL`, `Restfully` can use a configuration file so that you don't need
# to enter your credentials by hand. 
# Copy-paste the following in a terminal:
#
#     mkdir ~/.restfully
#     cat <<EOF > ~/.restfully/api.grid5000.fr.yml
#     base_uri: https://api.grid5000.fr/2.0/grid5000
#     username: "your-grid5000-login"
#     password: "your-grid5000-password"
#     EOF
#     chmod 600 ~/.restfully/api.grid5000.fr.yml
# 
# Then edit the `~/.restfully/api.grid5000.fr.yml` file to enter the correct
# information for `username` and `password`.
#
# Once you've done that, you need to install the following Ruby gems:
#
#     gem install restfully net-ssh-gateway
#
# And you should be ready to go! From your local machine, you can run the 
# script with:
#
#     curl -k https://raw.github.com/grid5000/tutorials/master/\
#     api/2.0/restfully-tutorial.rb | ruby
#
# Note that you can also use Restfully in an interactive manner:
# 
#     restfully -c ~/.restfully/api.grid5000.fr.yml
#
# Below you will find the annotated source code for the script.

# Prerequisites
# ---------------------------

# Here are the libraries that this script uses:
require 'rubygems'        # or: export RUBYOPT="-rubygems"
require 'restfully'       # gem install restfully
require 'net/ssh/gateway' # gem install net-ssh-gateway
require 'json'            # gem install json
require 'yaml'

# Initialization
# ---------------------------

# Declare a logger to log messages:
LOGGER       = Logger.new(STDERR)
LOGGER.level = Logger::INFO

# Load the Restfully configuration file that contains your API credentials.
CONFIG = YAML.load_file(File.expand_path("~/.restfully/api.grid5000.fr.yml"))

# Attempts to find a public SSH key in your home directory.
PUBLIC_KEY       = Dir[File.expand_path("~/.ssh/*.pub")][0]
fail "No public key available in ~/.ssh !" if PUBLIC_KEY.nil?

# Attempts to find the corresponding private part of the SSH key.
PRIVATE_KEY  = File.expand_path("~/.ssh/#{File.basename(PUBLIC_KEY, ".pub")}")
fail "No private key corresponding to the public key available in ~/.ssh !" unless File.file?(PRIVATE_KEY)

LOGGER.info "Using the SSH public key located at: #{PUBLIC_KEY.inspect}"

# Create an SSH gateway to access the Grid'5000 machines from outside.
# Note that this is not needed if you operate from a Grid'5000 frontend.
GATEWAY      = Net::SSH::Gateway.new('access.grid5000.fr', CONFIG["username"], :keys => "#{PRIVATE_KEY}")

# 
# Structures to keep track of the jobs and deployments we submit.
JOBS         = []
DEPLOYMENTS  = []

# We don't want to wait forever, right?
TIMEOUT_JOB  = 2*60 # 2 minutes
TIMEOUT_DEPLOYMENT = 15*60 # 15 minutes

# The command to run on each node after they are deployed:
COMMAND = "hostname"

# Be a good citizen and delete everything when an error or interruption occurs:
def cleanup!
  LOGGER.warn "Received cleanup request, killing all jobs and deployments..."
  DEPLOYMENTS.each{|deployment| deployment.delete}
  JOBS.each{|job| job.delete}
end

# Cleanup everything upon receiving SIGINT or SIGTERM:
%w{INT TERM}.each do |signal|
