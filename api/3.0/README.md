These files are the scripts to use with the version of the Grid'5000 API Tutorial created for the Winter School in Nantes, in December 2012. 

The tutorial is available at https://www.grid5000.fr/w/API_all_in_one_Tutorial.

The scripts are released under the CeCILL-B licence, a BSD like licence written for French law, so you can reuse and derive them for your work with little constraints.
